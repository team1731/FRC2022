# Team 1731 - FRC 2022
**Central repository for 1731 developers.**

## Regulations
 - Ensure your files are tabbed with tab size of 4.
 - Before pushing, make sure WPILib build is successful. (Alt + F5)
 - When working on new stuff, create a branch off of `dev`. DO NOT put your name in the branch, but rather the name of the feature you intend to work on.
 - Once your feature is tested out, [create a pull request](https://github.com/team1731/FRC2022/compare/dev...main) into `dev`.
   - If your feature builds off another feature that is not yet merged into `dev`, create the branch from `dev` and run `git rebase origin <branch>` before each push.
 - Code in `main` should only be competition ready code. Code in `dev` is considered untweaked. Please try to only deploy code from `main` during competitions.
